        <div>The most obvious question that engineering course applicants come across is the difference between B.Tech
            and B.E. If you would ask if they differ only in terms of names or in terms of their course syllabus also,
            here in this blog we have mentioned the possible doubts which will clear your clutter and give you a
            picturesque idea of what these courses are all about. In the engineering discipline, both these courses are
            equally equivalent and valuable. As a result, one can begin a career in one of the courses, which will
            undoubtedly assist one in reaching the key to success.</div>

            <h2> 1 .B.Tech and BE: Clarity in Terminology</h2>
            <p>B.Tech stands for Bachelor of Technology, whereas B.E stands for Bachelor of Engineering. There are a
                plethora of students who are in a dilemma regarding B.E and B.Tech because both these degrees are almost
                similar, but this is not the case.</p>
            <p>Both the Bachelor of Technology and the Bachelor of Engineering degrees have their own distinctions and
                significance. In terms of study, the main difference between B.Tech and B.E. is that B.Tech focuses on
                realistic application, whereas B.E. aims to focus on theoretical knowledge applied to practical
                situations.</p>

            </center>

            <p>To clear up the confusion, we would like to state unequivocally that B.Tech. and B.E. degrees are not
                transferable through distance learning. Students who are interested in distance B.Tech and distance B.E.
                should keep in mind that they must enrol in a regular college in order to pursue their passion for
                engineering.</p>

            <h2> 3. B.Tech and BE: Eligibility Criteria</h2>
            <p>Both B.Tech and B.E degrees have most things in common, and the eligibility criteria are almost the same
                to a great extent. The eligibility criteria for B.Tech and B.E. are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Candidates must have completed their higher secondary education or 12th grade in science streams,
                    with core subjects such as Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics.</li>
                <li> Candidates need to score a minimum of 50% marks in 12th grade from a recognised university or
                    institution.</li>
            </ul>
